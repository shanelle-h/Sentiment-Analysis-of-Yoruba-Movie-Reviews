# Sentiment Analysis of Yoruba Movie Reviews: Understanding Audience Perceptions and Emotions in Yoruba Cinema
 Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for understanding human emotions and opinions. However, there remains a gap in sentiment analysis research when it comes to underrepresented languages and cultural contexts. The purpose of this project is to examine the sentiments expressed in Yoruba movie reviews in order to better understand the audience perceptions and emotions related with Yoruba film. With the increasing popularity of Yoruba films and the distinct cultural setting they represent, it is critical to delve into the emotions conveyed by spectators. There shall be a collection of datasets of Yoruba movie reviews written in Yoruba language and sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques will be performed on those datasets. This will be done through processing of data, extracting relevant features and training a sentiment classification model, that way we will be able to uncover the positive, negative or neutral sentiments prevalent in these reviews. The findings of this project can help filmmakers, producers, and fans understand the influence and reception of Yoruba cinema, which can help enhance decision making processes, improve content creation and better cater to the expectations of Yoruba movie enthusiasts. This project will also emphasize the significance of cultural sentiment analysis and demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to assess sentiments in underrepresented languages and cultural contexts.
